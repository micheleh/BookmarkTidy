A Chrome extension that automatically organizes your bookmarks with intelligent sorting and management features.

## Features

### üóÇÔ∏è Automatic Folder Sorting
- Automatically organizes folders alphabetically
- Keeps subfolders at the top, followed by bookmarks
- Maintains clean folder structure

### üìà Sort by Use (Most Recent First)
- Moves recently visited bookmarks to the top of their folders
- Smart URL matching handles redirects and URL variations
- Works with login redirects and URL parameters

### üîß Bookmark Management Tools

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd BookmarkTidy
   ```

2. Load the extension in Chrome:

## How It Works

### Automatic Organization
The extension runs in the background and automatically:
- Sorts new bookmarks into organized folders
- Moves frequently used bookmarks to the top
- Maintains folder hierarchy with subfolders first

### Smart URL Matching
When you visit a webpage, the extension:
1. Captures the initial URL (before redirects)
2. Tracks the final URL after redirects
3. Attempts to match both URLs against your bookmarks
4. Uses domain-based fallback matching for complex redirects
5. Moves the matching bookmark to the top of its folder

### URL Variations Handled
- HTTP vs HTTPS protocols
- With/without www prefix
- URL parameters and tracking codes
- Login redirects with continue parameters
- Domain-based matching for complex redirects

## Settings

Access settings by clicking the extension icon and going to the Settings tab:

- **Automatic Folder Sorting**: Enable/disable automatic folder organization
- **Sort by Use**: Enable/disable moving recently used bookmarks to the top
